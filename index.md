Political Scientist (Ph.D. ABD)  
Conflict, sabotage, and political violence

## About

I am a political scientist and Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Political Science at Washington State University. My research examines conflict dynamics and political violence, with particular attention to sabotage and the strategic “weaponization of friction” across war and peace.

I have extensive teaching experience across community colleges and universities, including dual-enrollment programs and California’s Incarcerated Student Program. My teaching emphasizes equity-minded pedagogy, civic engagement, and helping students connect political theory to real-world institutions and conflicts.
