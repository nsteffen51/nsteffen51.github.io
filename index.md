## About

I am a political scientist and Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Political Science at Washington State University. My research examines conflict dynamics and political violence, with a focus on sabotage and the strategic “weaponization of friction” across war and peace.

I have extensive teaching experience across community colleges and universities, including dual-enrollment programs and California’s Incarcerated Student Program. My teaching emphasizes equity-minded pedagogy, civic engagement, and helping students connect political theory to real-world institutions and conflicts.
